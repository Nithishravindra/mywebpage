      <p>
        I'm Nithish Ravindra currently pursuing B.E in Computer Science from
        Vivesvaraya Technological University(VTU). It's been few months since I
        got into web development. Started with HTML, CSS and Javascript. I've
        picked ReactJS to help me through front-end. I've been also working on
        Backend Utilities like NodeJS, Python3, SQL and MongoDB to enhance
        Full-Stack services. You can view some of my work in Projects section of
        this site.
